This portfolio website I created represents my own work and dedication. While I independently developed the site, I also shared ideas with my peers, which helped enhance the final product. Their insights and feedback were invaluable in refining my design and functionality, resulting in a polished and comprehensive showcase of my skills and experience. Special thanks to [ Safaricom_Hook_Cohort_1_Peer_to_peer_Learning_Group_19 ] for their support.
